This repository provides two BPD models of RC joints, based on the study:
"Study on the Influence of Stirrups on the Shear Behaviors of Exterior RC Beam-Column Joints Based on Refined Peridynamic Simulation". by Ruijie Chang, Zhongyu Jiang, Quan Gu, and Ning Zhang.
To run the models, simply double-click the run.bat file.
Note: OpenSeesMP relies on the Message Passing Interface (MPI). To execute this program, you must install an MPI implementation such as MS-MPI (for Windows), OpenMPI, or MPICH.
